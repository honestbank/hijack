## Hijack (Hi Jack!)
Hijack lets you hijack graphql requests on the fly and return custom responses based on operation being fired.

### Examples:
Checkout [hijack_example_test.go](./hijack_example_test.go) for more info.

### Planned Features (PRs welcome)
- [ ] fixtures support
- [ ] handlers with input and operation name
