## Hijack (Hi Jack!)
Hijack lets you hijack graphql requests on the fly and return custom responses based on operation being fired.

### Examples:
https://github.com/honestbank/hijack/blob/1de6922b9579a6cbe2d7a5f44b38f5b16e248e20/hijack_example_test.go#L23-L45

### Planned Features (PRs welcome)
- [ ] fixtures support
- [ ] handlers with input and operation name
